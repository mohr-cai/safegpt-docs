- File browser

Uploaded documents can be:
- Analyzed individually
- Added to projects for organized knowledge collections
- Referenced in conversations with BusinessGPT

### Document Analysis

BusinessGPT analyzes your documents to extract useful information:

1. **Text Extraction**: Converts document formats to searchable text
2. **Content Understanding**: Comprehends the meaning and context of document content
3. **Question Answering**: Allows you to ask specific questions about the document content
4. **Source Attribution**: Provides transparent references to the source material

### Document Q&A

Once your documents are processed, you can ask questions about them directly in the chat interface:

- "What are the main points in this document?"
- "Summarize the key findings from this report"
- "What does the document say about [specific topic]?"
- "Find information about [specific term] in this document"

BusinessGPT will analyze the document content and provide answers based on the information contained within, including references to the source material.

## How to Use Document Processing

### Uploading Documents

1. Navigate to the Documents section in the BusinessGPT dashboard
2. Click "Upload" or drag and drop files into the designated area
3. Wait for processing to complete (time varies based on document size and complexity)

### Querying Documents

You can interact with your processed documents in two ways:

1. **Individual Document Analysis**:
   - Upload a document directly in a chat
   - Ask questions about the document content
   - BusinessGPT will analyze the document and provide answers

2. **Project-Based Document Analysis**:
   - Add documents to a project (see [Projects](/features/projects))
   - Reference the project in a chat
   - Ask questions about the documents in the project
   - BusinessGPT will search across all documents in the project to find relevant information

## Best Practices

For optimal results with document processing:

1. **Use clear, well-formatted documents** for better analysis
2. **Use high-quality scans** when uploading physical documents
3. **Ask specific questions** about document content
4. **Organize related documents in projects** for comprehensive analysis
5. **Verify critical information** from documents when necessary

## Security and Privacy

BusinessGPT maintains strict security measures for document processing:

- All documents are encrypted at rest and in transit
- Document access is controlled by user permissions
- Processing occurs in secure, isolated environments
- Documents are stored in European data centers
- Compliance with GDPR and other regulations

## Limitations

Current limitations of the document processing system:

- Very large documents may need to be split for optimal processing
- Complex tables and diagrams may not be perfectly analyzed
- Highly specialized technical content may require additional context
- Image quality affects text extraction accuracy
