2. Select the application you want to connect
3. Follow the authentication flow
4. Configure data sync settings
5. Test the connection

### API Integration

For custom integrations or applications without pre-built connectors:

1. Use our comprehensive [API](/api-reference/introduction) to:
   - Send data to BusinessGPT
   - Retrieve insights and analysis
   - Trigger actions based on BusinessGPT outputs
2. Leverage our SDKs for popular programming languages:
   - Python
   - JavaScript/TypeScript
   - Java
   - C#

### Webhooks

Set up webhooks to enable real-time communication:

1. Configure BusinessGPT to send data to your systems when specific events occur
2. Set up your systems to send data to BusinessGPT when relevant changes happen
3. Create automated workflows triggered by webhook events

### Custom Integrations

For enterprise customers with unique requirements:

1. Work with our solutions team to design custom integrations
2. Develop connectors for proprietary or legacy systems
3. Implement secure data exchange protocols

## Key Integration Scenarios

### Data Enrichment

Pull data from multiple sources to provide richer context:

- Enrich customer interactions with CRM data
- Incorporate financial data for more accurate analysis
- Add product information to enhance recommendations

### Workflow Automation

Create end-to-end business processes:

- Automatically generate reports from data analysis
- Create tasks in project management tools based on insights
- Send notifications when important patterns are detected

### Embedded AI

Embed BusinessGPT capabilities within your existing tools:

- Embed data analysis capabilities into your dashboards

## Setting Up Integrations

### Basic Integration Setup

To set up a basic integration:

1. Navigate to Settings > Integrations in the BusinessGPT dashboard
2. Click "Add Integration"
3. Select the desired application from the integration catalog
4. Follow the authentication steps (typically OAuth or API key)
5. Configure data access permissions
6. Select which data to sync and how frequently
7. Test the integration

### Advanced Configuration

For more complex integration needs:

1. Define data transformation rules
2. Set up field mappings between systems
3. Configure bi-directional sync settings
4. Establish error handling and notification preferences
5. Set up monitoring for integration health

## Security Considerations

All integrations in BusinessGPT are designed with security in mind:

- **Data Encryption**: All data transferred between systems is encrypted
- **Minimal Access**: Integrations use the principle of least privilege
- **Authentication**: Secure authentication methods (OAuth 2.0, API keys)
- **Audit Logging**: All integration activities are logged for security monitoring
- **Compliance**: Integrations maintain compliance with regulations like GDPR, HIPAA, etc.

## Troubleshooting

Common integration issues and solutions:

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Connection Failures">
    - Verify API credentials are valid and not expired
    - Check network connectivity between systems
    - Ensure firewall rules allow necessary connections
    - Verify the integrated service is operational
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Data Sync Issues">
    - Check for field mapping errors
    - Verify data format compatibility
    - Look for rate limiting or quota issues
    - Check for changes in the external API
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Performance Problems">
    - Optimize sync frequency for your needs
    - Consider incremental rather than full syncs
    - Check for large data volumes that may cause slowdowns
    - Monitor system resources during sync operations
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

## Best Practices

For optimal integration results:

1. **Start with clear objectives** for what you want to achieve with each integration
2. **Limit data transfer** to only what's necessary for your use case
3. **Test thoroughly** in a non-production environment before going live
4. **Monitor integration health** regularly
5. **Document your integration setup** for future reference
6. **Keep credentials secure** and rotate them periodically
