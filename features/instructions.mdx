# Instructions

The Instructions feature in BusinessGPT allows you to define specific, customizable instructions for the AI. These instructions serve as guidelines and ensure that the AI responds precisely to your individual requirements and the context of a particular task.

## What are Instructions?

Instructions in BusinessGPT are personalized directives that you can create and manage to guide the AI's responses. By establishing and managing these customized guidelines, you can achieve greater automation and accuracy when completing tasks.

- The task you want to accomplish (e.g., "Create a draft for..." or "Analyze the following data...")
- Relevant background information
- The desired format for the response (e.g., as a list, table, or structured text)
- The scope of the response (e.g., "in 3-5 bullet points" or "in about 200 words")

### Instruction Management

- Save instructions for future use
- Edit existing instructions
- Share instructions with team members

## Best Practices

For optimal results with instructions:

1. **Be specific and clear** in your directives
2. **Define the role** you want the AI to assume
3. **Specify the format** you prefer for responses
4. **Include relevant context** that helps the AI understand your needs
5. **Start with simple instructions** before creating more complex ones

## Example Instructions

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Marketing Content Creation">
    **Title**: Marketing Content Creator
    
    **Instruction**: Act as an experienced marketing content creator. When I provide a product or service description, create engaging marketing copy that highlights key benefits, addresses potential customer pain points, and includes a compelling call to action. Format your response with a headline, 3-4 short paragraphs, and 3-5 bullet points of key features. Keep the tone professional but conversational, and limit the total response to approximately 300 words.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Technical Documentation">
    **Title**: Technical Documentation Assistant
    
    **Instruction**: Act as a technical documentation specialist. When I provide information about a technical process or feature, create clear, concise documentation that would be understandable to users with basic technical knowledge. Structure your response with a brief overview, step-by-step instructions, and a troubleshooting section. Use simple language, avoid jargon where possible, and include notes for any steps that require special attention.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Meeting Summary">
    **Title**: Meeting Summarizer
    
    **Instruction**: Act as a professional meeting assistant. When I provide meeting notes or transcripts, create a structured summary that includes: 1) Key discussion points, 2) Decisions made, 3) Action items with responsible parties, and 4) Follow-up questions or unresolved issues. Format the summary in a clear, scannable way with headings and bullet points. Keep the summary concise, focusing only on substantive information, and highlight any deadlines mentioned.
