# Workspaces

## Overview

Workspaces in BusinessGPT allow you to organize your personal work into separate contexts. Each workspace serves as a container for related conversations and content, making it easier to switch between different topics, clients, or projects. Think of workspaces as separate "desks" where you can keep different sets of information organized and easily accessible.

## Creating a Workspace

To create a new workspace:

1. Navigate to the Workspaces section in the sidebar or User Panel
2. Click the "Add Workspace" button
3. Enter a descriptive name for your workspace (e.g., "Client A", "Research Project", "Personal Notes")
4. Click "Create" to finalize

## Workspace Organization

Each workspace provides a clean, separate environment for your work:

<CardGroup cols={2}>
  <Card title="Personal Context" icon="user">
    Each workspace maintains its own conversation history and context
  </Card>
  <Card title="Topic Separation" icon="folder">
    Keep different subjects or client information neatly separated
  </Card>
</CardGroup>

## Workspace Settings

Each workspace has basic configurable settings:

- **General Settings**: Workspace name and description

## Organizing Content

Within a workspace, you can organize your personal content:

- **Conversations**: Access your chat history specific to this workspace
- **Notes**: Keep workspace-specific information organized
- **Context**: Maintain separate conversation contexts for different topics

## Switching Between Workspaces

You can easily switch between different workspaces:

1. Click on the workspace selector in the User Panel or top navigation bar
2. Select the desired workspace from the dropdown menu
3. Your context will immediately switch to the selected workspace

This feature is particularly useful when working with different clients or projects, as it allows you to quickly switch between different contexts without mixing information.

## Use Cases for Workspaces

Workspaces are ideal for:

- **Client Management**: Create separate workspaces for different clients to keep their information organized
- **Project Organization**: Maintain distinct workspaces for different projects or initiatives
- **Topic Separation**: Keep work-related queries separate from personal research
- **Context Switching**: Quickly transition between different subject areas without losing context

## Best Practices

For optimal workspace management:

- **Create purpose-specific workspaces**: Dedicate workspaces to specific clients, projects, or topics
- **Use descriptive naming**: Choose clear, meaningful names that indicate the workspace's purpose
- **Regularly clean up**: Archive or delete workspaces that are no longer needed
- **Limit the number of workspaces**: Maintain only as many workspaces as you can effectively manage
