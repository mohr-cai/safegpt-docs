# Memory Function

The Memory Function in BusinessGPT (also known as Chat History Integration) allows you to control whether the system uses your past conversations as context for generating responses in current and future interactions.

## Overview

The Memory Context function gives you flexible control over how your conversation history is utilized as context for the language model. You can decide if BusinessGPT should use information from your past conversations to provide more contextually relevant responses, or if it should only consider the current conversation.

## Key Features

### Personalized Context Control

- Toggle conversation history context on or off for each conversation
- Control how your past interactions influence current responses
- Customize your experience based on continuity needs and privacy preferences
- Switch between modes at any time during a conversation

### Context Utilization

When conversation history context is enabled:
- BusinessGPT uses relevant information from past conversations as context
- Provides more contextually aware responses based on your conversation history
- Offers more personalized suggestions based on your previous interactions
- Creates a more coherent user experience for ongoing projects

### Current-Session Focus

When conversation history context is disabled:
- BusinessGPT only considers the current conversation for generating responses
- Past conversations don't influence the current interaction
- Ideal for starting fresh or when previous context isn't relevant
- Provides more independent responses for each new conversation

## How to Use the Memory Function

### Toggling Conversation History Context

1. Look for the Context Toggle symbol below the chat interface
2. Click on the symbol to activate or deactivate the conversation history context
3. When the toggle is on (highlighted), BusinessGPT will use past conversations as context
4. When the toggle is off, BusinessGPT will only consider the current conversation

### When to Use Conversation History Context

- **Enable conversation history context** for:
  - Long-term projects requiring continuity
  - Complex tasks spanning multiple sessions
  - Personalized assistance that builds on previous interactions
  - Situations where context from previous conversations enhances current responses

- **Disable conversation history context** for:
  - Starting fresh discussions without previous influence
  - One-time queries that don't benefit from previous context
  - When you want more independent responses
  - When previous conversations might confuse the current topic

## Best Practices

For optimal use of the conversation history context function:

1. **Consider the nature of your task** before deciding whether to enable conversation history context
2. **Be mindful of the conversation flow** and how previous context might influence current responses
3. **Periodically review your settings** to ensure they match your current needs
4. **Disable conversation history context when starting a new topic** that shouldn't be influenced by previous discussions
5. **Enable conversation history context for complex projects** to maintain continuity across sessions

## Privacy and Security

BusinessGPT is designed with privacy in mind:

- Your conversations are stored securely regardless of context settings
- The context toggle only affects how the language model uses your conversation history
- Context settings are applied on a per-conversation basis
- You maintain control over your interaction experience at all times
