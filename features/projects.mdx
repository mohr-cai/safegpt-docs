# Projects

The Projects feature in BusinessGPT allows you to create, organize, and share collections of documents as thematic knowledge bases. Projects serve as repositories for topic-specific content that can be analyzed, searched, or shared within a team.

## What are Projects?

Projects in BusinessGPT are organized collections of documents like Word, PDF, or PowerPoint files that form a topic-based knowledge database. They enable departments to consolidate their expertise and make it accessible to other employees, enhancing collaboration and efficiency.
