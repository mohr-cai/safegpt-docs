# Frequently Asked Questions

This section addresses common questions about BusinessGPT, its features, and how to use it effectively.

## Available Language Models

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Which AI models are available in BusinessGPT?">
    BusinessGPT currently supports models from ChatGPT (OpenAI) and Claude (Anthropic). This selection is based on the availability of EU-hosted models with relevant performance characteristics. Depending on your requirements, you can use different models for different tasks. Our portfolio is continuously expanded with new models from existing and additional providers.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="How do the available models differ in performance?">
    The models differ in capabilities, speed, and cost. GPT-4o offers the most comprehensive capabilities for complex tasks, while models like GPT-4.1 Nano are faster and more cost-effective for simpler requests. Claude models are characterized by particularly nuanced text processing and longer context windows. The model selection should be made according to the task at hand.
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

## Unique Features

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="What makes BusinessGPT special?">
    BusinessGPT stands out through several core features: multi-model support, project-specific knowledge bases through document uploads, cross-team collaboration, and customizable assistants with user-defined instructions. Vendor independence gives you full flexibility in model selection. Unlike public chatbots, your data is not used for training purposes and remains protected.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="How does BusinessGPT differ from Microsoft Copilot?">
    Unlike Microsoft Copilot, BusinessGPT is vendor-independent and not limited to the Microsoft ecosystem. BusinessGPT also offers advanced features for collaborative knowledge management, flexible model selection, and customized AI assistants, and can be used in a variety of use cases.
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Is there a file size limit for uploads?">
    Yes, there are file size limits to ensure optimal performance:

    - **Individual file limit**: 20MB per file
    - **Total upload limit per session**: 100MB
    - **Project storage limit**: Depends on your subscription plan

    For large documents exceeding these limits, we recommend:

    1. Splitting the document into smaller sections
    2. Compressing images within documents before uploading
    3. Converting to more efficient formats (e.g., from DOCX to PDF)
    4. Removing unnecessary elements like large images or embedded media

    If you regularly need to work with larger files, contact your administrator about upgrading your subscription plan.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="How do attachments work in BusinessGPT?">
    Attachments in BusinessGPT can be used in two ways:

    **Direct Chat Attachments**
    - Upload files directly in a chat session by clicking the attachment icon or dragging and dropping files
    - Files are immediately processed and available for that specific conversation
    - The AI can analyze and reference the content of these files in its responses
    - Direct attachments are temporary and primarily intended for the current chat session

    **Persistent Attachments in Projects**
    - Files uploaded to projects are stored permanently (until deleted)
    - They can be accessed across multiple chat sessions
    - Multiple users can access these files if they have permission to the project
    - Project attachments are ideal for frequently referenced documents or collaborative work

    All attachments are processed using OCR (Optical Character Recognition) for images and appropriate parsers for other file types to extract text content that the AI can work with.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="What's the difference between knowledge folders and direct attachments?">
    **Knowledge Folders (Projects)**
    - Permanent storage solution for documents
    - Organized in a structured way with folders and subfolders
    - Searchable across the entire content
    - Shareable with team members
    - Ideal for building a knowledge base over time
    - Content is indexed for semantic search
    - Can be referenced across multiple conversations
    - Permissions can be managed at the folder level

    **Direct Attachments**
    - Temporary usage for immediate needs
    - Tied to a specific conversation
    - Not automatically shared with others
    - Ideal for one-time document analysis
    - No folder structure or organization
    - Not automatically saved for future reference
    - Simpler to use for quick tasks

    **When to use which:**
    - Use knowledge folders (projects) for documents you'll reference repeatedly or share with colleagues
    - Use direct attachments for quick, one-time document analysis or when privacy is a concern

    You can always move a direct attachment to a knowledge folder later if you decide it should be preserved.

## Common Issues

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Unclear or irrelevant answers">
