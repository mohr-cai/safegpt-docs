# Chat Interface

The BusinessGPT Chat Interface allows you to interact with the AI using natural language, making it easy to ask questions, request information, and perform tasks related to your business.

## Getting Started with Chat

The chat interface is the primary way to interact with BusinessGPT. You can access it from the main dashboard by clicking on the "Chat" tab in the navigation menu.

## Key Features

### Natural Language Understanding

BusinessGPT understands natural language queries related to your business. You can ask questions in plain English, and the AI will interpret your intent and provide relevant responses.

### Context Awareness

The chat interface maintains context throughout your conversation, allowing for follow-up questions and a more natural dialogue. BusinessGPT remembers previous messages in the current session to provide more relevant and coherent responses.

### Business Data Integration

When connected to your business data sources, BusinessGPT can reference and analyze your data to provide informed responses:

- Query financial data: "What were our Q2 sales compared to Q1?"
- Analyze customer information: "Show me our top 10 customers by revenue"
- Retrieve document information: "Summarize the latest marketing report"

### Multi-modal Capabilities

BusinessGPT can process and generate different types of content:

- Text responses for questions and explanations
- Data tables for structured information
- Charts and graphs for data visualization
- Document summaries and extractions

## Best Practices

To get the most out of the BusinessGPT chat interface:

1. **Be specific in your requests** - The more specific your question, the more accurate the response will be.
2. **Start with simple queries** - Begin with straightforward questions before moving to more complex requests.
3. **Provide context when needed** - If your question requires specific context, include it in your message.
4. **Use follow-up questions** - Ask follow-up questions to drill down into details.
5. **Verify important information** - While BusinessGPT strives for accuracy, always verify critical business information.
