## Basics of prompting

Effective prompts are the key to better results with BusinessGPT. A well-structured prompt leads to more accurate, relevant, and useful responses.

## Structure of a good prompt

### 1. Clear role assignment
Define the role that the AI should take on:

```
You are an experienced marketing expert. Analyze the following campaign...
```

### 2. Provide context
Provide relevant background information:

```
Our company is a B2B software provider with 50 employees.
We develop CRM solutions for small and medium-sized businesses.
```

### 3. Define a specific task
Formulate your request precisely:

```
Create a 10-point checklist for introducing our software to new customers.
```

### 4. Specify the desired format
Specify how the answer should be structured:

```
Format the answer as a numbered list with a short explanation for each point.
```

## Proven techniques

### Chain of thought (step-by-step thinking)
Ask the AI to explain its thought process:

```
Explain step by step how you arrived at this solution.
```

### Few-Shot Learning (Provide examples)
Provide examples of the desired result:

```
Here are two examples of good product descriptions:
1. [Example 1]
2. [Example 2]

Now create a similar description for our product.
```

### Iterative refinement
Refine your prompts based on the results:

```
That's good, but can you make it more specific to our target audience?
```

## Avoid common mistakes

### ❌ Too vague requests
**Bad:** “Write something about marketing.”
**Better:** “Create a 5-point strategy for social media marketing for B2B companies”

### ❌ Missing context
**Bad:** “How can I improve this?”
**Better:** “How can I improve this email campaign? [Insert email text]”

### ❌ Multiple tasks in one prompt
**Bad:** “Analyze the market, create a strategy, and write a business plan.”
**Better:** Break this down into separate, focused prompts.

## Special techniques for BusinessGPT

### Use knowledge bases
Refer to uploaded documents:

```
Based on the uploaded manual, explain the most important features of our software.
```

### Optimize model selection
- **GPT-4o**: For complex analysis and creative tasks
- **Claude**: For nuanced text processing and longer documents
- **Faster models**: For simple questions and summaries

### Use slash commands
Use `/[search term]` to quickly access prompts and knowledge bases.

## Prompt templates

### Analysis template
```
Role: [expert role]
Context: [background information]
Task: Analyze [element to be analyzed]
Focus: Concentrate particularly on [specific aspects]

```

### Creation template

## Advanced strategies

### Persona-based prompting
Create detailed personas for consistent results:

```
You are Sarah, a 35-year-old marketing manager with 10 years of experience
in the tech industry. You are analytical, but also creative, and pay
particular attention to ROI optimization.
```

### Constraint-based prompting
Set deliberate limits for more focused results:

```
Explain the concept in a maximum of 3 sentences, do not use technical terms,
and address it to people with no prior experience.
```

### Multi-step prompting
Break complex tasks down into steps:

```
Step 1: Analyze the data
Step 2: Identify the 3 most important trends
Step 3: Develop recommendations for action for each trend
```

## Quality control

### Evaluate results
- Is the answer complete?
- Does it match the desired format?
- Is it appropriate for the target audience?
- Are all important points covered?

### Iterative improvement
```
That's a good start. Can you elaborate on point 3
and add a concrete example?
```

## Tips for different use cases

### Business documents
- Use professional language
- Structure clearly with headings
- Ask for sources for facts

### Creative content
- Set the style and tone
- Use inspiring examples

### Technical documentation

By applying these best practices, you can significantly improve the quality and relevance of BusinessGPT's responses and work more efficiently.
