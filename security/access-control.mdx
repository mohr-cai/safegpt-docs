# Access Control in BusinessGPT

## Authentication

BusinessGPT implements robust authentication mechanisms to ensure that only authorized users can access the platform:

### Single Sign-On (SSO)

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion icon="key" title="Azure AD Integration">
    BusinessGPT integrates seamlessly with Azure Active Directory, allowing organizations to:
    - Use existing corporate identities
    - Apply consistent access policies
    - Enforce password complexity requirements
    - Implement conditional access policies
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion icon="shield-check" title="Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA)">
    All users are required to use multi-factor authentication, which provides:
    - An additional layer of security beyond passwords
    - Protection against credential theft and phishing attacks
    - Compliance with security best practices and regulations
    - Support for various authentication methods (authenticator apps, SMS, etc.)
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

### Session Management

BusinessGPT implements secure session management practices:

- Secure, HTTP-only cookies with appropriate security flags
- Automatic session timeout after periods of inactivity
- Session invalidation upon logout
- Protection against session fixation attacks

## Authorization

BusinessGPT uses a comprehensive role-based access control (RBAC) system to ensure users can only access the resources and perform the actions they are authorized for:

### Role-Based Access Control

<CardGroup cols={3}>
  <Card title="Owner" icon="crown">
    Full control over resources, including user management and deletion
  </Card>
  <Card title="Editor" icon="pen-to-square">
    Can create, modify, and collaborate on content
  </Card>
  <Card title="Viewer" icon="eye">
    Read-only access to designated resources
  </Card>
</CardGroup>

### Permission Levels

Access control is implemented at multiple levels:

1. **Organization Level**
   - Controls who can access the organization's BusinessGPT instance
   - Manages organization-wide settings and policies

2. **Project Level**
   - Determines who can access specific projects
   - Controls project-specific settings and configurations

3. **Resource Level**
   - Governs access to individual chats, documents, and other resources
   - Enables fine-grained sharing and collaboration

## User Management

BusinessGPT provides comprehensive user management capabilities:

### User Provisioning

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion icon="user-plus" title="User Onboarding">
    - Automated user provisioning through Azure AD
    - Invitation-based user registration
    - Self-service account creation (if enabled)
    - Initial role assignment
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion icon="user-minus" title="User Offboarding">
    - Immediate access revocation
    - Data transfer options for user content
    - Audit trail of user activities
    - Compliance with data retention policies
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

### User Administration

Administrators have access to powerful user management tools:

- User activity monitoring and reporting
- Role and permission management
- Access policy enforcement
- Bulk user operations

## Audit and Compliance

BusinessGPT maintains comprehensive audit logs to track access and actions:

- Authentication events (successful and failed login attempts)
- Authorization decisions
- Resource access and modifications
- Administrative actions

These logs can be:
- Retained according to configurable retention policies
- Exported for compliance reporting
- Integrated with SIEM systems (for Enterprise customers)
- Used for security incident investigation

## Best Practices

We recommend the following access control best practices:

1. **Implement the principle of least privilege**
   - Assign users the minimum permissions needed for their role
   - Regularly review and adjust permissions as needed

2. **Enforce strong authentication**
   - Require MFA for all users
   - Set appropriate password policies

3. **Regular access reviews**
   - Periodically audit user accounts and permissions
   - Remove access for departed employees promptly

4. **Segregation of duties**
   - Separate administrative responsibilities
   - Ensure critical actions require multiple approvers
