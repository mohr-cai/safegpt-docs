# Account Settings

The Account Settings include all preferences and adjustments for a specific user. They only apply to this specific user and no one else. The account settings can be set by any user.

## Profile

The profile section allows you to upload an image and change your name, email, and password.
To change an email address, contact support ([support@eraneos.com](mailto:support@eraneos.com)).

## Preferences

Depending on your experience and your preferences, you can configure your account to suit your individual needs.

You can select a default model. This model is selected in every new chat unless you change it in the top left corner.

You can enable or disable chat capabilities like web search, image generation, or data analysis. Without the ability, no chat in your account will be able to use the according capability.

Below that, you can set the app language. Currently, we support English and German.

## Custom Instructions

You can add information about yourself or how the answers should be written in the settings. This text applies to all messages you send to an AI model. In the resources section, you find a guide with examples of what to add in custom instructions.

## Knowledge Folders

You can add files into a knowledge folder and attach this folder to an assistant. This is helpful to attach a large documentation with many files to an FAQ or support assistant. This functionality works slightly differently than attaching files directly to an assistant.

## Privacy

BusinessGPT uses telemetric data to improve the product. In the privacy settings, you can opt out of telemetry and analytics.
