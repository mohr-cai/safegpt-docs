# Chat Completions

The Chat Completions endpoint is the core of BusinessGPT's conversational capabilities. It allows you to send messages and receive AI-generated responses that can be used in chatbots, virtual assistants, and other conversational interfaces.

## Request Body

<ParamField body="messages" type="array" required>
  An array of message objects representing the conversation history.

  Each message object contains:
  - `role` (string): The role of the message sender. Can be "system", "user", or "assistant".
  - `content` (string): The content of the message.
</ParamField>

<ParamField body="model" type="string" default="businessgpt-default">
  The model to use for generating completions. Options include:

  - `businessgpt-finance`: Specialized for financial contexts
  - `businessgpt-legal`: Specialized for legal contexts
</ParamField>

<ParamField body="temperature" type="number" default="0.7">
  Controls randomness in the response. Lower values (e.g., 0.2) make responses more focused and deterministic, while higher values (e.g., 0.8) make responses more creative and varied.
</ParamField>

<ParamField body="max_tokens" type="integer" default="1024">
  The maximum number of tokens to generate in the response.
