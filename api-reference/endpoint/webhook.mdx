# Webhooks

BusinessGPT webhooks allow you to receive real-time notifications when specific events occur in your BusinessGPT account. This enables you to build integrations that respond automatically to events like document processing completion, analysis results, or chat interactions.

## Setting Up Webhooks

To use webhooks, you need to:

1. Register a webhook endpoint URL in your BusinessGPT account
2. Select the events you want to subscribe to
3. Implement a webhook receiver at your endpoint URL to process the events

## Webhook Events

BusinessGPT can send webhook notifications for various events:

<CardGroup cols={2}>
  <Card title="Document Events">
    - `document.processed`: Document processing completed
    - `document.failed`: Document processing failed
    - `document.updated`: Document metadata updated
    - `document.deleted`: Document deleted
  </Card>
  <Card title="Analysis Events">
    - `analysis.completed`: Data analysis completed
    - `analysis.failed`: Data analysis failed
    - `analysis.scheduled`: Scheduled analysis triggered
  </Card>
  <Card title="Chat Events">
    - `chat.message.created`: New message in a chat
    - `chat.session.ended`: Chat session ended
    - `chat.feedback.received`: User feedback received
  </Card>
  <Card title="Account Events">
    - `user.created`: New user created
    - `user.updated`: User information updated
    - `team.member.added`: Team member added
    - `usage.limit.approaching`: Usage limit approaching
  </Card>
</CardGroup>

## Webhook Payload

When an event occurs, BusinessGPT sends an HTTP POST request to your webhook URL with a JSON payload containing event details.

### Common Payload Structure

All webhook payloads include these common fields:

<ResponseField name="event_type" type="string">
  The type of event that triggered the webhook (e.g., "document.processed").
</ResponseField>

<ResponseField name="event_id" type="string">
  A unique identifier for this event.
</ResponseField>

<ResponseField name="created_at" type="string">
  ISO 8601 timestamp when the event occurred.
</ResponseField>

<ResponseField name="account_id" type="string">
  The ID of the BusinessGPT account that the event belongs to.
</ResponseField>

<ResponseField name="data" type="object">
  Event-specific data. The structure varies depending on the event type.
</ResponseField>

### Event-Specific Payloads

Different events include different data in their payloads. Here are examples for common events:

#### Document Processed Event

```json
{
  "event_type": "document.processed",
  "event_id": "evt_123abc",
  "created_at": "2023-06-15T10:30:45Z",
  "account_id": "acc_xyz789",
  "data": {
    "document_id": "doc_456def",
    "title": "Vendor Agreement 2023",
    "status": "completed",
    "processing_time": 3.45,
    "pages": 12,
    "file_type": "pdf",
    "extracted_entities_count": 37,
    "confidence_score": 0.92
  }
}
```

#### Analysis Completed Event

```json
{
  "event_type": "analysis.completed",
  "event_id": "evt_789ghi",
  "created_at": "2023-06-16T14:22:33Z",
  "account_id": "acc_xyz789",
  "data": {
    "analysis_id": "an_abc123",
    "query": "What were our top-selling products last quarter?",
    "status": "completed",
    "execution_time": 2.34,
    "data_points_analyzed": 1240,
    "insight_count": 5,
    "visualization_count": 2
  }
}
```

## Security

### Webhook Signatures

To verify that webhook requests are coming from BusinessGPT, we include a signature in the `X-BusinessGPT-Signature` header of each request. This signature is a HMAC SHA-256 hash of the request body, using your webhook secret as the key.

Example of verifying the signature in Node.js:

```javascript
const crypto = require('crypto');

function verifyWebhookSignature(requestBody, signature, secret) {
  const hmac = crypto.createHmac('sha256', secret);
  const expectedSignature = hmac.update(requestBody).digest('hex');
  return crypto.timingSafeEqual(
    Buffer.from(signature),
    Buffer.from(expectedSignature)
  );
}

// In your webhook handler:
const isValid = verifyWebhookSignature(
  requestBody,
  req.headers['x-businessgpt-signature'],
  process.env.WEBHOOK_SECRET
);

if (!isValid) {
  return res.status(401).send('Invalid signature');
}
```

### Best Practices

For secure and reliable webhook processing:

1. Always verify the webhook signature
2. Implement idempotency to handle duplicate events
3. Respond quickly to webhook requests (within 5 seconds)
4. Implement retry logic for failed webhook processing
5. Store the raw webhook payload before processing

## Testing Webhooks

You can test your webhook implementation using the BusinessGPT developer console:

1. Go to Settings > API & Webhooks
2. Enter your webhook URL
3. Select an event type
4. Click "Send Test Event"

This will send a test event to your webhook endpoint with sample data.

## Webhook Management

Manage your webhooks through:

- **API**: Use the Webhooks API to programmatically create and manage webhooks
- **Dashboard**: Configure webhooks in the BusinessGPT dashboard under Settings > API & Webhooks
- **CLI**: Use the BusinessGPT CLI to manage webhooks with commands like `businessgpt webhooks create`
