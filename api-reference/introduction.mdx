## Getting Started

To use the BusinessGPT API, you'll need:

1. A BusinessGPT account with API access enabled
2. An API key for authentication
3. Understanding of REST API principles
4. Knowledge of your specific integration requirements

Our API follows RESTful principles and uses standard HTTP methods. All requests and responses are in JSON format.

## Authentication

All API requests require authentication using API keys. Include your API key in the Authorization header of your requests:

```bash
Authorization: Bearer YOUR_API_KEY
```

<Note>
  Keep your API keys secure and never expose them in client-side code. Use environment variables or secure vaults to store your keys.
</Note>

## Rate Limits

API usage is subject to rate limits based on your subscription plan:

| Plan | Rate Limit | Burst Limit |
| ---- | ---------- | ----------- |
| Standard | 60 requests/minute | 100 requests/minute |
| Professional | 300 requests/minute | 500 requests/minute |
| Enterprise | Custom | Custom |

If you exceed your rate limit, the API will return a 429 Too Many Requests response.

## Error Handling

The API uses standard HTTP status codes to indicate success or failure:

- 2xx: Success
- 4xx: Client error (invalid request)
- 5xx: Server error

Error responses include a JSON body with details:

```json
{
  "error": {
    "code": "invalid_parameter",
    "message": "The parameter 'limit' must be a positive integer",
    "details": {
      "parameter": "limit",
      "value": "-5"
    }
  }
}
```
